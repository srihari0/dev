Pod Security admission (PSA) is enabled by default in v1.23 and later, as it has graduated to beta. Pod Security is an admission controller that carries out checks against the Kubernetes Pod Security Standards when new pods are created. This tutorial shows you how to enforce the baseline Pod Security Standard at the cluster level which applies a standard configuration to all namespaces in a cluster.

To apply Pod Security Standards to specific namespaces, refer to Apply Pod Security Standards at the namespace level.
